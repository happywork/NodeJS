                            You will need to transfer mXRB to the deposit address on your account page. There are 2 addresses shown in your account because you can use both bitcoin and ethereum to deposit. If you do not have any bitcoin or ethereum, we can recommend you deposit some cryptocurrencise and transfer to your account addresses. Remember, you can withdraw directly to the bitcoin or ethereum addresses on your account page!

                        <p>On your account page, you can transfer bit to any Bitcoin or Ethereum address you want. Small withdrawals (i.e. smaller than the balance of our hot-wallet) are processed instantly and you will be given the transaction ID immediately. </p>
                        <p>Larger withdrawals will be shown in your withdrawal page as "PENDING" and will require us to manually remove sufficient funds from our cold storage. Usually this process will take less than two hours, but may take up to 24 hours, depending on the time of day and other circumstances. </p>
                        <p>Withdrawals must be in increments of 1 bit, with a minimum withdrawal of 10000 bits. No need to worry about mining fees with RaiBlocks! </p>

                        <p>
                            Upon detecting that you have disconnected we cash you out (assuming the game is still in progress). Regardless of whether your client is connected or not, the <em>auto cash-out</em>
                            feature will work as expected (it happens on the server), and we highly recommend you use it if internet reliability or performance is a concern.

                        <p>There's no real limit! However, if during a game we ever are facing a net loss of 3% of the bankroll or greater, the server will automatically cash out all players still in the game, forcing them to enjoy an early win and a sizeable profit. You can see in game what the current max win is (in the bottom right of the chart) </p>

                            What is the bonus?
                        </b>
                        <p>
                            The bonus is a special prize that is awarded to the last people to cash out before the game busted. Getting the bonus is critical to skillful playing of raigames, as it is the <strong>only</strong>
                            way to overcome house odds.
                        </p>
                        <p>1% of each player's stake goes into the bonus pot. So if there are 4 players, betting 400, 300, 200, and 100, there will be 10 bits in the pot. If the biggest player wins, he gets the whole pot. The site works out the rate he would be getting if he won, ie. 400 bits bet gives 10 bits bonus - or 1/40th bonus per bits bet. It then applies the same rate to whoever actually wins. </p>
                        <p>So if the 100 bits player wins, he gets 1/40th of 100, or 2.5 bits. That leaves 7.5 bits in the pot, which goes to the next best placing player(s). </p>
                        <p>Suppose the 200 bits player comes 2nd. He is due 1/40th of 200, or 5 bits. There are still 7.5 bits in the pot, so he gets the full 5 bits he is due - the same as if he had come in 1st place. </p>
                        <p>Suppose the 300 bits player comes 3rd. He's due 7.5 bits (300/40) but there are only 2.5 bits left in the pot, so he gets those and that's all. There's nothing left for the 4th or worse place players. </p>
                        <p>1% of games will instant bust (0x) and no bonuses will be awarded, all other games have bonuses equal to 1% of the amount wagered. </p>

                            What are the game odds?

                        <p>
                            The house margin is scaled between 0 and 1 %, depending on how long you hold. An additional 1 % is effectively taken from every bet and put into the <a href="#bonus">bonus pool</a>
                            , which is distributed in its entirety every game. As a consequence, skilless or random play has—at worst—an expected return of -2 %, but it is possible to overcome the house margin by skillfully getting bonuses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The numbers are baked into the game, so you never need to worry about it. We do not have a fixed house margin, as this would prevent highly conservative play (e.g. If you were only attempting to make $2 in a $100 game, a house margin of 1 % would be 50 % of your potential profits!). Our unique formula makes it fair for both highly conservative play (cash out early) and highly aggressive play (hold until you're a millionaire). All games are <a href="#fair">provably fair</a>
                            .
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The exact formula for the houses expected return is:<br/>
                            <code>1 % * (intendedCashOut - roomAmount) * (roomAmount / intendedCashOut)</code>
                            <br/>
                            But to really get a good sense of how this affects you, please use our handy <a href="/calculator">odds calculator</a>
                            .
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other important thing to keep in mind is that every game has a 1 % chance of instantly busting. We do not make <strong>any</strong>
                            money on it, but rather use this to fund the bonus scheme. This is an important consideration to make if you are playing in such a way that you never win the bonus.

                            How is the game bust calculated?
                        </b>
                        <p>The code that decides the multiplier for each round is here: </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://github.com/moneypot/bustabit-gameserver/blob/master/server/lib.js#L146-L158">https://github.com/moneypot/gameserver/blob/master/server/lib.js#L146-L158</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It basically does three things. </p>
                        <p>First, it mixes the hash with the clientSeed (decided by the provably fair seeding event) using hmac-sha256 </p>
                        <p>Secondly it gives a 1 in 101 chance of instant busting </p>
                        <p>Third, it works out what the multiplier would be if there was no house edge. </p>
                        <p>Fourth, it takes 1% off the multiplier and adds on 0.01x: </p>
                        <p>So half the time (other than 0x bust which we can ignore because they pay for themselves with the bonus) the multiplier will be 1.99x or more. </p>
                        <p>That means if we bet 1.99x we have a 50% chance of winning (again, ignoring 0x busts), and so the house edge is: </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>100 - (1.99 * 50) = 100 - 99.5 = 0.5%</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>The extra 0.01 that gets added on to the multiplier is half of the 1% that was taken off in this case, leaving the house edge at 0.5%. As the multiplier gets bigger, the 1% that is taken off gets bigger, and the 0.01x that gets added on becomes less and less significant, causing the house edge to tend to 1% </p>

                            What happens when the server forces people to cash out?
                        </b>
                        <p>Under some circumstances the server will force people to cash out. The most common reason is that the game multiplier has gotten so large that we are risking too much of our bankroll (10 % or more). Another possible reason is unexpected server problems. If more than one person in a game is affected by the forced cash-out, we allocate the last cash-out bonus to a random player. </p>

                            Do you have gambling addiction?
                        </b>
                        <p>Gambling addiction, also known as compulsive gambling, is a type of impulse-control disorder. Compulsive gamblers can’t control the impulse to gamble, even when they know their gambling is hurting themselves or their loved ones. Gambling is all they can think about and all they want to do, no matter the consequences. Compulsive gamblers keep gambling whether they’re up or down, broke or flush, happy or depressed. Even when they know the odds are against them, even when they can’t afford to lose, people with a gambling addiction can’t “stay off the bet.” </p>
                        <p>Gamblers can have a problem, however, without being totally out of control. Problem gambling is any gambling behavior that disrupts your life. If you’re preoccupied with gambling, spending more and more time and money on it, chasing losses, or gambling despite serious consequences, you have a gambling problem. </p>
